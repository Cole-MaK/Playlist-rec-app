# Playlist-rec-app
This project was created because I hate going through my whole Daylist or Discover Weekly playlists just to go through many songs that I don't like. So I created this app so I could get recommendations based on songs I already like. Just authorize, click on one of your playlists and then the daylist or Discover Weekly and wait for the results :D.

## How to Use?
This application utilizes the Spotify API so you will need to follow these steps:
1. Create an account on Spotify's API site https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
